# Devops Playground

This is just a POC to use a Terraform to deploy some infrastructure in AWS.
Para la poc se utilizo una api y una web que se obtuvo desde aca [React Exress App Medium Tutorial](https://github.com/Joao-Henrique/React_Express_App_Medium_Tutorial)

This repository contains four distinct sections:

* [Api](./api): everything related to API (node api).
* [Client](./client): everything related to the website (react website).
* [Infrastructure](./infrastructure): everything related to infrastructure deployment using Terraform.
* [Deployment](./deployment): everything related to day-to-day deployment of an application to the cloud.

Every directory contains specific documentation, so be sure to check them out.
