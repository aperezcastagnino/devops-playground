# Infrastructure and Deployment

This repository contains two distinct sections:

* [Infrastructure](./infrastructure): everything related to deployment of infrastructure using Terraform.
* [Deployment](./deployment): everything related to day-to-day deployment of an application to the cloud.

Every directory contains specific documentation, so be sure to check them out.
